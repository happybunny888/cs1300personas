		</div>
		<div class="d-flex lead article-entry">
			<ul type = "-">
				<li>Most users park 3 or 4 hours to go to a Brown University tour and to eat. 
					They do not usually add time to their ticket.
					One user parked for a day to visit a friend at Brown University.</li>
				<li> Users often keep an eye on the time, since Brown tours are about 2 hours, and then some time for 
				food and drink, which brings them to almost the ticket's expiry time. One user did say they would set an alarm. </li>
				<li> Most users will make the final decision at the meter of how long they will park.</li>
				<li> One user remarked that it is hard to see the text on the screen due to the bright sun. 
					The text changing to yellow when the option is selected is also hard to differentiate. 
				</li>
				<li>Users say that it is generally easy to use since the screen writes out full instructions and options. 
					This meter accepts card (not only coins) and does not require entering license plate or card info
					manually. Most have not used the other parking meters in the city, one user remarked
					that the prices at this meter are more expensive. </li>
